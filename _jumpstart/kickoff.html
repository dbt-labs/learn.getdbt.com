# Deadlines and Pull Request Groups

- The goal is to complete the asynchronous sessions 24 hours before each Office Hours
- This includes: Watching the videos, completing practice exercises, and answering surveys.
- This will allow instructors to shape the office hours during the morning of the training.
- Pro Tip: Consider blocking 3 hours on your calendar between sessions to complete the work.  It's a lot easier to dive deep for 1 three-hour session than 3 one-hour sessions.

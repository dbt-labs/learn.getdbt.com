# The Big Idea

* Let's keep the old table, and we'll just _add_ the _new_ records
* Less wasteful and probably faster
* We just need to know:
    * What we mean by "new"
    * What we mean by "add"
* As long as we have good answers, we're in good shape

# Why?

* It costs time (and money) to transform data
* Historical data doesn't (shouldn't) change
* If you can get away _without_ re-transforming historical data, you save time and money

# Example: Snowplow events

* Page views and pings on **learn.getdbt.com**! One was fired just now, as you're reading this. And... now :)
* Create a source like so:

```yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: snowplow
    database: raw
    loaded_at_field: collector_tstamp

    freshness:
      error_after: {count: 1, period: hour}

    tables:
      - name: events
```

---

### We've got a model: events &rarr; page views

.denser-text[
{% raw %}
```sql
with events as (
    select * from {{ source('snowplow', 'events') }}
),

page_views as (
    select * from events
    where event = 'page_view'
),

aggregated_page_events as (
    select
        page_view_id,
        count(*) * 10 as approx_time_on_page,
        min(derived_tstamp) as page_view_start,
        max(collector_tstamp) as max_collector_tstamp
    from events
    group by 1
),

joined as (
    select
        *
    from page_views
    left join aggregated_page_events using (page_view_id)
)

select * from joined
```
{% endraw %}
]

# Tactics

- How do we want to materialize this model?

--
    - Start with `view`
    - When it takes too long to query, switch to `table`
    - When it takes too long to build, switch to `incremental`

--

- How can we make this incremental?

---

# Building an incremental model

**1. ❓ How do we tell dbt to add new rows instead of recreating the table?**

--

{% raw %}
```sql
{{ config(
    materialized = 'incremental'
) }}

```

{% endraw %}

---

# Building an incremental model

**1. ✅ How do we tell dbt to add new rows instead of recreating the table? **

--

**2. ❓ How do we identify new rows?**

--

💡 What if we compared the source data to the already-transformed data?

--

As a statement, run:

{% raw %}
```sql
select max(max_collector_tstamp) from {{ ref('page_views') }}
```
{% endraw %}

How do we integrate this into our model?

---
# Building an incremental model

**1. ✅ How do we tell dbt to add new rows instead of recreating the table?**

**2. ❓ How do we identify new rows _on "subsequent" runs only?_**

--

{% raw %}
```sql
with events as (
    select * from {{ source('snowplow', 'events') }}
    {% if is_incremental() %}
    where collector_tstamp >= (select max(max_collector_tstamp) from {{ this }})
    {% endif %}
),
...
```
{% endraw %}

---

# Special Jinja variables

### {% raw %}`{{ this }}`{% endraw %}

.dense-text[Represents the currently existing database object mapped to this model.]

### `is_incremental()`

.dense-text[Checks four conditions:]
.denser-text[
1. Does this model already exist as an object in the database?
2. Is that database object a table?
3. Is this model configured with `materialized = 'incremental'`?
4. Was the `--full-refresh` flag passed to this `dbt run`?
]

.dense-text[Yes Yes Yes No == an incremental run]

???
If all of the conditions are met, `is_incremental()` returns `true`.

## Run 1:
.denser-text[
`$ dbt run -m page_views`

Excerpts from logs:
```sql
create or replace transient table analytics.dbt_alice.page_views as (
    with events as (
        select * from raw.snowplow.events
    ),
    ...
)

```
]

---
## Run 2:
.denser-text[
`$ dbt run -m page_views`

Excerpts from logs:
```sql
create or replace temporary table analytics.dbt_alice.page_views__dbt_tmp as (
    with events as (
        select * from raw.snowplow.events
        where collector_tstamp >= (select max(max_collector_tstamp) from analytics.dbt_alice.page_views)
    ),
    ...
)

```

```sql
insert into analytics.dbt_alice.page_views (
  "SESSION_ID", "ANONYMOUS_USER_ID", "PAGE_VIEW_ID", "PAGE_URL", "APPROX_TIME_ON_PAGE", "PAGE_VIEW_START", "MAX_COLLECTOR_TSTAMP"

(
    select "SESSION_ID", "ANONYMOUS_USER_ID", "PAGE_VIEW_ID", "PAGE_URL", "APPROX_TIME_ON_PAGE", "PAGE_VIEW_START", "MAX_COLLECTOR_TSTAMP"
    from analytics.dbt_alice.page_views__dbt_tmp
);
```
]
???
Teacher note: see the insert! cool!

## Run 3 (full refresh):
.denser-text[
`$ dbt run -m page_views --full-refresh`

Excerpts from logs:
```sql
create or replace temporary table analytics.dbt_alice.page_views as (
    with events as (

# Under the hood

What's the DDL/DML that dbt is running?

1. Create a temp table of new records
2. Reconcile the existing table with the temp table, using one of:
    - `merge`
    - `delete` + `insert` ("upsert")
    - `insert overwrite` ("replace") _entire partitions_

Depends on:
- database support (e.g. Redshift does not have a `merge` statement)
- user input: `incremental_strategy` ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models/#what-is-an-incremental_strategy))

# How do you set the cutoff?

What if data arrives _really_ late?

--

In our opinion, the goal of incremental models is to _approximate_ the "true" table in a fraction
of the runtime:
- Perform an analysis on the arrival time of data
- Figure out your organization's tolerance for correctness
- Set the cutoff based on these two inputs
- Once a week, perform a `--full-refresh` run to get the "true" table

--

"Close enough & performant"

# Our Snowplow data:

.left-column-66[
<img src="/ui/img{{page.id}}/prop-late-arriving.png" class="img-center">
X: days between firing + collection
Y: % of all events
]

.right-column-33[
- Dataset: 2.5 months of Snowplow data, 285mm events
- 99.82% of events arrive within 1 hr of firing
- 99.88% within 24 hr
- .highlight[99.93% within 72 hr]
- ∴ 3 day cutoff, refresh weekly
]

We'd end up under-counting the page view duration.

But, maybe we're okay with that, page view durations aren't _that_ important.

# What if...

We want to calculate window functions?

- `page_view_for_user_index`

# Too clever by half

<img src="/ui/img{{page.id}}/how-too-clever.png" class="img-center" style="width: 50%;">

- Whenever a user has a new session, pull the user's _most recent session only_,
and perform relative calculations
- This takes some hard thinking! E.g. [Segment package](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/segment/blob/master/models/sessionization/segment_web_sessions.sql#L67)

# What about _truly_ massive datasets?

Bigger datasets (and Big Data technologies) are different cost-optimization problems.
- Always rebuild past 3 days. Fully ignore late arrivals.
- Always replace data at the _partition level_.
- No unique keys.
- Targeted lookback? No way: too much extra data to scan.
- Avoid full refreshes

We're going to talk about this next :)

---

## Should I use an incremental model?

### Good candidates
- Immutable event streams: tall + skinny table, append-only, no updates
- If there _are_ any updates, a reliable `updated_at` field

### Not-so-good candidates
- You have small-ish data
- Your data changes constantly: new columns, renamed columns, etc.
- Your data is updated in unpredictable ways
- Your transformation performs comparisons or calculations that require
other_ rows (table + view)

---

# Incremental models introduce tradeoffs:

* Most incremental models are "approximately correct"
* They introduce a level of code complexity (i.e. how easy it is for someone to understand your code)
* Prioritizing correctness can negate performance gains from incrementality

Think of incremental models as an _upgrade_, not a _starting point_.

---
# If you do use incremental models:

Keep the inputs and transformations of your incremental models as
singular, simple, and immutable as possible.
- Slowly changing dimensions, like a `product_name` that the company
regularly rebrands? Join from a `dim` table.
- Window functions for quality-of-life counters? Fix it in post—i.e., a separate model.
This is how our Snowplow package calculates each user's `session_index`.

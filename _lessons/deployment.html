# Deploying your dbt project

---

# We've built our first models... now what?

--

- How will our team members access them? They are currently in a schema named `dbt_alice`

--

- What happens if our underlying data gets updated? (It should!)

--

- What happens if we add new models, or change existing ones?

---

# Solution:

--

- Run dbt on a schedule
- Use a "trusted" schema for this run

Also known as:
- Running dbt in production
- Deploying your dbt project

# A question for your engineering team:
## .grey[_How does your engineering team's code get deployed?_]

---

# A thought experiment:
## .grey[_Your solution is to set up a daily cron job on an EC2 server_]

---
# Considerations

Does your production run:
* Use the latest version of your dbt project? → **continuous deployment**
* Use the latest dbt version?
* Have monitoring and alerting if something goes wrong?
* Have a way to debug failures?
* Have a secure access model?
* Build & test your code every time you want to merge changes? →  **continuous integration**
* Have a secure way to host your project documentation?

# Our recommendation: dbt Cloud

_(Obviously we're biased)_

The scheduler in dbt Cloud is purpose built for running dbt jobs on a schedule.

# The pieces you'll need
- An orchestration tool:
    - Airflow ([related video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6dPIXGj29M)), Jenkins, Luigi, ...
- Artifact storage:
    - S3, GCS
- CI/CD Server:
    - CircleCI, GitLab, Jenkins
- ...

(Left as an exercise to the reader)

# Why another option might be right for your team:
- Preexisting architecture
- Integration with custom data ingestion
- Data security compliance
- Advanced configuration + control, e.g. only running changed models on CI runs

# Demonstration: Scheduling a run in dbt Cloud

You'll need:
- A deployment environment
- A job, which includes:
    - Commands
    - A schedule

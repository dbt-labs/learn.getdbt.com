# Testing

???
**Continue the story:** Make a connection to content that was just covered and how we might build off it.

Example: We just spent sometime modeling the data for customers, orders, (and payments).  Now that we have these models being built, we want to ensure that we can trust the data!  This is where testing comes in.

**Focus:** This is your opportunity to bring focus to the rest of the session. You can do this by... 
- slowing down just a little bit and reading each line with a bit of context OR
- asking a learner to read these to the room

# Refresher:

### The [dbt Viewpoint](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/about/viewpoint/)
_**Analytics code should have quality assurance**_
* _Run automated tests on source data and on transformed data to ensure that SQL works as intended_
* _Ensure source data is up to date_

--

❓ **What are some ways that you have seen data _break_ in your experience?**

???

**Hook:** Use this an an opportunity to drive engagement and get folks invested in this lesson.

Example:
- ask 2-3 people to share how data broke in their organization
- ask for emoji reaction is something similar has happened
- make a connection to testing to lead into the next slides

# What are tests?

**Tests** are assertions you make about your **models**.

When your assertion is true, your tests pass.

You configure tests in YML, in the `models` directory.

Behind the scenes, test are just `select` statements!

---
# Examples:
.left-column[
```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null

```
]
--
.right-column[
```sql

select
  count(*)

from analytics.customers
where customer_id is null

```

]
???
Teacher notes: talk about how these relate
---

# Examples:
.left-column[
```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

```
]
--

.right-column[
```sql

select count(*) from (
  select
    customer_id

  from analytics.customers
  group by customer_id
  having count(*) > 1
)

```
]

---

# How do we run tests?

Run all tests: `dbt test`

Run specific tests: `dbt test -m one_specific_model`

???

Pause the deck here and jump into the IDE to show the following:
- copy the snippet of code for a schema.yml file to show how to configure tests
- run dbt test
- click into the palette to show off how the tests get compiled to a Select statement that is run against the materialized model.


---

# What happens when you run `dbt test`?

1. dbt connection to your **data warehouse** (via a **profile/connection**)
2. dbt parses your **dbt project**
3. dbt iterates through the resource files (`models/**.yml`) to construct `select` queries.
4. dbt executes the SQL for each test: if the number `0` is returned your test passes

---

# dbt's built-in tests:
.left-column[
* **`unique`**
* `not_null`
* `accepted_values`
* `relationships`
]

.right-column[
Every value in this column is unique.


]

---
# dbt's built-in tests:
.left-column[
* `unique`
* **`not_null`**
* `accepted_values`
* `relationships`
]

.right-column[
Every value in this column is not null.


]


---
# dbt's built-in tests:
.left-column[
* `unique`
* `not_null`
* **`accepted_values`**
* `relationships`
]

.right-column[
Every value in this column is a value from a given list.

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values:
                - placed
                - shipped
                - completed
                - returned
```
]

---
# dbt's built-in tests:
.left-column[
* `unique`
* `not_null`
* `accepted_values`
* **`relationships`**
]

.right-column[
Each value in this column exists in the column of another table.

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('customers')
              field: id

```

# Q: Why might a test fail?
--

1. The SQL in your model doesn’t do what you intended.

--

```sql
select
    orders.order_id,
    payments.payment_id
from orders
left join payments
    on orders.order_id = payments.payment_id
```
```yml
models:
  - name: fct_orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
```

???
Examples:
* Bad deduping
* Bad joins

---
# Q: Why might a test fail?

1. The SQL in your model doesn’t do what you intended.
2. An assumption about your source data is wrong.
--


```sql
select
    orders.order_id,
    payments.payment_id
from orders
left join payments
    on orders.order_id = payments.order_id
```
```yml
models:
  - name: fct_orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
```
---
# Q: Why might a test fail?

1. The SQL in your model doesn’t do what you intended.
2. An assumption about your source data is wrong.
    * non-unique IDs
    * 1:many instead of 1:1
    * Missing data
    * NULLs you weren't expecting

---
# Q: Why might a test fail?

1. The SQL in your model doesn’t do what you intended.
2. An assumption about your source data is wrong.

--
3. A previously-true assumption about your underlying source data is no longer true
--

    * A previously unique key is no longer unique
    * You have a new payment method

---
# Q: What should you test?
--

* Good rules of thumb:
    * Test primary keys (`unique`, `not_null`)
    * Test fields that you use in downstream models

---
# Q: When should you run tests?
--

* Manual: When you first run a project
* Manual: During development
* Automated: When you run dbt on a schedule
* Automated: When you want to merge your code

## Checkpoint

.left-column[
```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: payments
    columns:
      - name: payment_id
        tests:
          - not_null

```
]

.right-column[
- What are we testing for based on this configuration? (Be specific)
]

???

**Check for Understanding:** Ask the group to chat in their responses to this question.
- Celebrate a specific answer like: "We are testing that the payment_id is not_null and unique on the payments model."

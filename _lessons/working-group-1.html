Notes for what to walk students through
* Give them a brief tour of the IDE: the file tree, file editor, the "Preview Data" and "Compile SQL" buttons, the results tab, and command line.
* When creating the staging models explain that best practice is to create one staging model per raw data table and to do some minimal cleanup and re-naming.
* For each model created, run dbt run and look at the logs to talk through what is happening.

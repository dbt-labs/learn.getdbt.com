# Sources

---

# If you've ever had this happen...

- I'm switching my email marketing platform. I want to know which final models depend on that source data.
--

- I'm switching the tool that extracts and loads _from_ my email
marketing platform. The table names used to have underscores, now they don't!
--

- I'm switching from Redshift to Snowflake. All of my source data will be
in a different database and schema.
--

- Nothing in this world is perfect. My data loading tools experience occasional
hiccups that result in delayed or duplicated data.
--

- (!!) I want to stage & query an external table that points to files in S3.

---

# Sources may be right for you!

- Easily declare and update the location of raw tables
    - `database` + `schema` for each source
    - `name`/`identifier` for each table
--
- Test schema integrity of raw tables
    - Built-in: `unique`, not_null`, `accepted_values`, `relationships`
    - Custom: whatever you want!
--
- Test the freshness of loaded data, based on thresholds you define
--

- (!!) Declare `external` properties ([read more](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-external-tables))

---

# YML

I define my sources in `stripe_source.yml`:
```yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: stripe
    tables:
      - name: payment
```

---

# Feeling fresh?

Optionally, specify a `loaded_at_field` and `freshness`:
```yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: stripe
    loaded_at_field: _batched_at
    loader: airflow     # this is just for documentation

    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
      error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}

    tables:
      - name: payment
```

---

# SQL

And then I create a staging model, `stg_stripe_payment.sql`:

{% raw %}
```sql
with source as (

    select * from {{source('stripe', 'payment')}}

),

renamed as (

...
```
{% endraw %}

.left-column-33[
# And green is good!
]

.right-column-66[
```bash
dbt source snapshot-freshness
```
<img src="/ui/img{{page.id}}/freshness-viz.png" style="width: 100%;" class="img-center">

# In deployment

A common approach: Test the schema integrity of raw tables _before_
replacing production models.

```bash
dbt test -m source:*            # ensure no duplicates or unexpected nulls
dbt run                         # only runs if test above succeeds
dbt test --exclude source:*
dbt source snapshot-freshness   # powers freshness viz in dbt Cloud
```

Of course, many deployments are _much_ more complex.

???
More complex deployments:
- Blue/green that renames schema/database at last step (if all tests pass) or
leaves old objects in place (if a test fails)

# Working session
* Add `sources` for our two data sources: `jaffle_shop` and `stripe` (make sure you select from the {% raw %}`{{ source }}`{% endraw %} in your models)
* Add a freshness block to at least one source, and snapshot the freshness
    * Note: use a dummy `loaded_at_field` to get the freshness test to pass:
    ```yml
    loaded_at_field: "current_timestamp"
    freshness: ...
    ```
* Add tests to these sources, and try running these tests

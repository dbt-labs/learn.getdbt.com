# Packages

---
# What are packages?
--

Packages are dbt projects that you can install in your _own dbt project_

They have:
* A `dbt_project.yml` file
* And contain macros, models etc.


???
Teacher notes:
* We're starting with a very literal example (using macros), and then going to talk more broadly about packages.
Before we hit databases, there's a nice story of "woah that's a package, which is just a dbt project? you know what else has a dbt project? (A: dbt)."
Or, "yo why is there 138 macros in our project when we only added one".
And from there we can talk a little bit about writing custom tests + using custom schemas + custom aliases + custom overviews. Once you get that concept down, it's so easy to understand how you can get dbt to do things you want it to do

# Use case: Using macros from a package

1. Add a `packages.yml` file to your project

--

```yml
# packages.yml
packages:
  - package: fishtown-analytics/snowplow
    version: 0.7.1

  - git: "https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils.git"
    revision: 0.1.21

```
???
* Discuss when to use which syntax
---
# Use case: Using macros from a package

1. Add a `packages.yml` file to your project
--

2. Run `dbt deps` to install the package (check out the `modules` dir!)
```shell
$ dbt deps
```
???
* Show the  modules directory
* Note that these are .gitignored

# Use case: Using macros from a package

1. Add a `packages.yml` file to your project
2. Run `dbt deps` to install the package
--

3. Access macros from the package
{% raw %}
```sql
-- models/utils/util_days.sql
{{ dbt_utils.date_spine(
    datepart="day",
    start_date="to_date('01/01/2016', 'mm/dd/yyyy')",
    end_date="current_date"
   )
}}
```
{% endraw %}

# Use case: Using macros from a package

1. Add a `packages.yml` file to your project
2. Run `dbt deps` to install the package
3. Access macros from the package

```yml
# models/marts/core/schema.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: companies
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "assets - liabilities = equity"
```

???
* Go through some of the most common macros in dbt-utils (there might be overlap with previous lesson)
---
# Q: What happens when you add a package with models in it?
--

These models get added to your DAG!

# Use cases for packages:
## Macros:
* Versatile macros, especially for “How to Write this in SQL” problems ([dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/))
* Ad hoc queries/snippets you find yourself writing over and over ([audit_helper](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/audit_helper/latest/), [codegen](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/codegen/latest/))

## Models:
* Common staging models for one data source ([facebook](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/facebook_ads/latest/))
* Follow industry standards for boilerplate-yet-complex modeling ([snowplow](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/snowplow/latest/), [segment](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/segment/latest/))

# Working session
## Using macros from a package:
* Add [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/) to your dbt project
* Use a macro from dbt-utils (e.g. `date_spine` to create a table of all days)


---
# Hold up, what about all those other macros?
Even before we added `dbt_utils`, we had a ton of macros whenever we ran dbt.

This slide is truly for curious minds.
--

dbt is itself [a package](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/tree/dev/barbara-gittings/core/dbt/include/global_project)!
* a.k.a "the dbt global project"
* Tests are macros prefixed with `test_`
* Materializations use macros

???
Hint: we might need this information later today!

# Everything's a project!
So:
* You have your own dbt project
* You also have the dbt global project
* You can also install additional projects as packages

---

## What happens if you create a macro with the same name as a global macro?
--


If you have a macro in _your project_ with the same name as macro in the _dbt global project_, your version is preferred! This means you can:
* Change the way dbt generates schema + and relation names
* Change the way tests are implemented
* Even change materializations!

## Overriding the dbt global project
* Change the way that dbt generates schema names ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas#section-changing-the-way-dbt-generates-a-schema-name)).

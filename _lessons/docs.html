# Why is documentation important?

_Low quality research manifests as an environment of knowledge cacophony,
where teams only read and trust research that they themselves created._
- Chetan Sharma and Jan Overgoor, [Scaling Knowledge at Airbnb](
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091)

&nbsp;

_If you don't know, now you know._
- Notorious B.I.G., "Juicy"

# Our favorite metaphor

* Analytics engineers are librarians.
* Documentation is the card catalog.
* The goal is to empower analyst-researchers.
--

* _The libarian and the card catalog do not replace each otherâ€”they reinforce and enable each other!_

### Analytics is the organization of an organization's information.

not docs.getdbt.com, though those are also great

### Example (from the [MRR playbook](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/mrr-playbook))

{% raw %}
```yml
models:
  - name: mrr
    description: "{{ doc('mrr') }}"

    columns:
      - name: id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: mrr
        description: Monthly recurring revenue in dollars.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: change_category
        description: "{{ doc('change_category') }}"
```

---

### `docs` blocks

.dense-text[
```md
{% docs mrr %}
This model represents one record per month, per account (months have been filled
in to include any periods of inactivity).

This model classifies each month as one of: `new`, `reactivation`, `upgrade`,
`downgrade`, or `churn`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs change_category %}

| Category       | Definition                                                                                              |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| new            | The customer is a new customer that has not had a previous subscription                                 |
| churn          | Last month the customer paid for a subscription, but this month is not. A customer can churn many times |
| upgrade        | The customer has increased their usage and is now paying you more money per month                       |
| downgrade      | The customer has decreased their usage and is now paying you less money per month                       |
| reactivation   | A previously churned customer has started subscribing again                                             |
| (null)         | No change compared to last month                                                                        |

# Our strong opinions!

Given:
* Code is _surface area_. Testing and documentation are _coverage_.
* Untested, undocumented code _cannot be trusted_. In some sense, it is worse
than having no code at all.

Therefore:
* Data documentation that seeks to accurately describe data transformation _must_
be updated as part of the same workflow as the transformation logic it seeks to
describe. If the two are separate, documentation will _always_ lag behind.

# dbt Learn Values
## 1. Be curious!
For students: ask questions!
For teachers, teach the why behind things, more than the how (this encourages curiosity), and be flexible in the exact material we teach to cater for curious minds

## 2. Learn from each other
While we (Fishtown) are dbt experts, everyone brings their own experience to the course, which we can all learn from.
Students should contribute to discussions, and help each other in working sessions.

If you have a question that we aren't ready to answer _just yet_, we'll jot it down for later.

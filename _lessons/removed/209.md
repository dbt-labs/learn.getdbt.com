# V0: Use a `post-hook` to grant:
<!--
We can nix all of this, it gets really long!
-->
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml

seeds:
  post-hook: "grant select on {{ this }} to role reporter;"

models:
  post-hook: "grant select on {{ this }} to role reporter;"

on-run-end:
  - "grant usage on schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"

```
???
* {{ this }} is the current model / seed

--
## Problems:
* Results in a lot of grant statements

---
# V1: Use `on-run-end` hooks to grant
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml

on-run-end:
  - "grant usage on schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
  - "grant select on all tables in schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
  - "grant select on all views in schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
```
--
## Problems:
* Downtime between when a model builds and when the `reporter` role can read it

---
# V2: Use `on-run-end` hooks + future grants
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml

on-run-end:
  - "grant usage on schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
  - "grant select on all tables in schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
  - "grant select on all views in schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
  - "grant select on future table in schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
  - "grant select on future views in schema {{ target.schema }} to role reporter;"
```

???
On Postgres/Redshift, use default grants

--
## Problems
* This is getting verbose...
* And what about custom schemas?

---
# V3: Use a macro
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml

on-run-end:
  - "grant_select_on_schemas(schemas, 'reporter')"
```

```sql
-- macros/grant_select_on_schemas.sql
{% macro grant_select_on_schemas(schemas, role) %}
  {% for schema in schemas %}
    grant usage on schema {{ schema }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on all tables in schema {{ schema }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on all views in schema {{ schema }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on future tables in schema {{ schema }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on future views in schema {{ schema }} to role {{ role }};
  {% endfor %}
{% endmacro %}
```
--
## Problems
* None, but we can show off here!

???
* Snowflake has a concept of "all X in database"
* Since we use one database for all of our relations, let's just grant privileges to the entire database
* We only need to run this once! That sounds like an `operation` (Flip back to operation slide)

---
# V4: Use an operation & database-wide grants
(Snowflake only!)
```sql
-- macros/grant_select_on_database_operation.sql
{% macro grant_select_on_database(role, database=target.database) %}

{% set grant_sql %}
    grant usage on database analytics to {{ role }};

    grant usage on all schemas in database {{ database }} to role {{ role }};
    grant usage on future schemas in database {{ database }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on future tables in database {{ database }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on future views in database {{ database }} to role {{ role }};

    grant select on future views in database {{ database }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on all tables in database {{ database }} to role {{ role }};
{% endset %}

{% do run_query(grant_sql) %}

{% endmacro %}
```
```bash
$ dbt run-operation grant_select_on_database --args '{role: "reporter"}'
```
???
* Note the `run_query` macro â€” with hooks we could just generate the SQL. In operations we need to _run_ the SQL.

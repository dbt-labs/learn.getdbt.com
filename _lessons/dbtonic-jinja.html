# dbtonic Jinja

### [Jinja Docs](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/) / [docs.getdbt.com](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/writing-code-in-dbt/jinja-context/adapter)

???
We've added to the Jinja library!
---

# refs

`{{ ref(stg_stripe_payment) }}`

.grey[`dev_jerco.stg_stripe_payment`]

**`analytics.stg_stripe_payment`**

&nbsp;

Use it always! This is how dbt:
* Mananages environments
* Infers all model dependencies (DAG)

---

## project-level vars

.dense-text[

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
models:
  my_dbt_project:
  vars:
    the_distant_future: '2099-12-31'    # default value
```

```sql
select
  id,
  valid_from,
  coalesce(valid_to, '{{ the_distant_future }}'::timestamp) as valid_to
from {{ ref('stg_subscriptions') }}

```
]

--

.dense-text[
```sql
select
  id,
  valid_from,
  coalesce(valid_to, '2099-12-31'::timestamp) as valid_to
from dbt_claire.stg_subscriptions
```
]
---

# Hot tip

You can override global vars with a CLI flag:
.dense-text[
```sql
select
  id,
  valid_from,
  coalesce(valid_to, '{{ the_distant_future}}'::timestamp) as valid_to
from {{ ref('stg_subscriptions') }}
```

```bash
dbt run --vars '{"the_distant_future": "2199-12-31"}'
```
]
--
.dense-text[
```sql
select
  id,
  valid_from,
  coalesce(valid_to, '2199-12-31'::timestamp) as valid_to
from dbt_claire.stg_subscriptions
```
]

# Logging

```jinja
{% macro grant_on(user, object, privilege) %}

	grant {{ privilege }} on {{ object }} to {{ user }}

    {% set message %}
        User {{ user }} is ready to rock & roll with {{ privilege }} on {{ object }}
    {% endset %}

	{% do log(message, info = true) %}

{% endmacro %}
```

```sql
{{ grant_on('fishtown_jeremy', 'analytics.stg_stripe_payment', 'select') }}
```
--
```
User fishtown_jeremy is ready to rock & roll with select on
analytics.stg_stripe_payment
```

# Logging

Especially useful when you're working on:
- Complicated macros
- Macros that call other macros
- Macros that run introspective queries against the database¹
- Macros that are run as operations¹
- Custom materializations¹

¹Topics for later (or another time)!
---

# Comments

```sql
-- this is a SQL comment
/* as is this */
```
```jinja
{# whereas this is a Jinja comment #}
```

- Only SQL comments show up in your compiled code
    - Jinja comments for dbt things
    - SQL comments for modeling/business logic
- Be careful about having the two in close proximity!

---

# Whitespace control

Add dashes to remove whitespace from compiled output:
- `{{ this }}` &rarr; `{{- this -}}`
- `{% set this="hi" %}` &rarr; `{%- set this="hi" -%}`
- `{# this #}` &rarr; `{#- this -#}`


```jinja
yeah
{# this will be an empty line in the compiled code #}
good.
{#- but this will not! -#}
ok.
```
--
```
yeah

good.ok.
```


---

# Macros
* Macros are written in `.sql` files in the `macros` directory

```sql
-- macros/cents_to_dollars.sql

{% macro cents_to_dollars(column_name, precision=2) %}
    ({{ column_name }} / 100)::numeric(16, {{ precision }})
{% endmacro %}

```

* Then you can call them in models. Take care with quoting!

```sql
-- models/staging/stg_stripe__payments.sql

select
  {{ epoch_to_timestamp('amount') }} as amount_usd
  ...
```
---
# Should I use a macro for that?
Macros introduce tradeoffs:
* Pros of macros:
    * Reduce repeated code
    * Allow you to do things you might not otherwise be able to do in SQL
* Cons of macros:
    * Make it harder for someone else to read your code

---

# You love to see it:

* `set`-ing at the top of files (feels pythonic)
* Formatting code for Jinja-readability (rather than compiled SQL)
* Using whitespace like `{{ this }}` not `{{this}}`
* Using argument names for complex macros
* Macro filenames that match macro names
* Leveraging package macros where possible

???
## You hate to see it
* Models that are entirely macros: https://github.com/Datavault-UK/snowflakeDemo/blob/master/models/load/stage/v_stg_inventory.sql

# Knowledge check
You should be able to:
* Use SQL + Jinja to pivot a table
* Have a sense for when to use the Jinja docs vs. when to use the dbt docs
* Know where to get started to write your own macro

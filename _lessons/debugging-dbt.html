# Cool error, dude!

# What is dbt doing under the surface?

1. **Connecting** to your database
2. **Parsing** all the code in your project
3. **Compiling** all your models
4. **Running** those models, in order, against the database
5. **Testing** your models by running queries that validate assumptions

---

# First thing's first: what kind of error?

.left-column[
- Parsing error (YML)
- Database error
    - Connection
    - Permissions
    - SQL
        - syntax
        - actual data
]

.right-column[
- dbt "errors"
    - Model, source, or data test failure
    - Compilation error
    - Deprecation warning/error
]

???
If it's a deprecating warning/error, that's easy — you should upgrade :)

# What do to when...

---

# You can't run dbt

- Is this a dbt project?
- Can you connect to the database?
- What's going on???

# Answer:

```bash
dbt debug
```

### You're seeing a parsing/compilation error

.dense-text[
```bash
Encountered an error:
Compilation Error
  Error reading acme: schema.yml - Runtime Error
    Syntax error near line 27
    ------------------------------

    Raw Error:

]

# Next step: reproduce the error

```bash
dbt compile
```

_Hopefully_, the error includes the path to the offending file :)

```bash
Error reading acme: schema.yml - Runtime Error
    Syntax error near line 27

# You're seeing a Database Error

```bash
Encountered an error:
Database Error: Snowflake absolutely hates the code you've written
```

# Maybe...

.left-column-33[
- Your model SQL has syntax errors
    - Missing a comma
    - Too many commas
    - Your database will know this right away!
]

.right-column-66[
.left-column[
- Your SQL conflicts with underlying data
    - You're trying to cast a string value to `int`
    - Your database will figure this out mid-query!
]
.right-column[
- You're asking too much of your database
    - `Disk full`
    - `Compilation memory exhausted`
    - `Each row cannot be >2 MB`
    - Your database won't know what hit it :(
]
]
---

# Next step: get the SQL!

.left-column[
### dbt CLI:
```
target/compiled/my_project/my_model.sql
target/run/my_project/my_model.sql
```
]

.right-column[
### dbt Cloud:
- Development: open the model and hit "compile SQL"
- Deployment: grab from run artifacts
]

Iterate:
- Visually inspect the SQL
- Try running the model chunk by chunk (CTEs)
- Refactor as needed

---

# You're seeing an error and have no idea where to start

Your best bet is to see _exactly_ the SQL that dbt is running against
your database.

Every last line of it.

# Next step: to the logs!

# Your results aren't right

.left-column-33[
This is a different kind of "error"!

If you didn't have tests, you wouldn't know anything is wrong.

# Next step: test for yourself

.left-column[

```

.right-column[
### dbt Cloud:
- Development: `dbt test`, check the "Debug" logs
- Deployment: grab from run artifacts

Iterate:
- Run the SQL
- Tweak it to return examples of offending records
- Thank your past self, the one who added tests :)

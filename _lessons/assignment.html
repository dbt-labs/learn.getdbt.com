# How to work through this assignment

To get the most value out of this assignment, we recommend that you:
1. First, attempt to complete the exercise by using [docs.getdbt.com](https://docs.getdbt.com/). Learning how to use the docs will set you up well to keep improving over time.
2. If you're stuck, use the slides from the related session
3. If you're really really stuck, ask someone in your breakout group (including your tutor)
4. If you're really really really stuck, each exercise maps to a separate pull request [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-learn-demo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+) which you can use to see how we completed this exercise.
5. If you get yourself into an absolute tangle, consider forking the above [demo repo](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-learn-demo/) to get back on track.

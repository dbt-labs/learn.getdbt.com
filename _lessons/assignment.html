# How to work through this assignment

To get the most value out of this assignment, we recommend that you:
1. First, attempt to complete the exercise by using [docs.getdbt.com](https://docs.getdbt.com/). Learning how to use the docs will set you up well to keep improving over time.
2. If you're stuck, use the slides from the related session
3. If you're really really stuck, ask someone in your breakout group (including your tutor)
4. If you're really really really stuck, each exercise maps to a separate pull request [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-learn-demo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+) which you can use to see how we completed this exercise.
5. If you get yourself into an absolute tangle, consider forking the above [demo repo](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-learn-demo/) to get back on track.

# Pre-requisites

Before going further, make sure:
1. You have completed the [pre-work](https://docs.getdbt.com/learn/setting-up/)
2. You have added a `fct_orders` model to your project (from [this morning's session](dbt-fundamentals#working-session))
3. You know the GitHub URL for your repository (and the repository is on your personal account, and is set to public)
4. You can run `dbt run` and `dbt test` without any errors

---

# Follow a git flow
For each exercise, we recommend you:
1. Checkout a new branch:
    - **dbt CLI:** In the terminal: `git checkout -b name-of-exercise`
    - **dbt Cloud:**
    ...
2. Make your changes, ensure they work, and then commit your changes
3. Open up a pull request:
    - Navigate to your repository in GitHub
    - Click the "New pull request" button
4. [Bonus] Assign it to a classmate to review:
    - You will need to add your classmate as a [collaborator](https://help.github.jp/enterprise/2.11/user/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)

# 1. Refactor your project

Based on our discussion in [Designing a data modeling project](modeling-project-design), refactor your project to be consistent with how we (Fishtown) structure our dbt projects. Consider
- model naming
- organization within directories

## Bonus:
Try using the [schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas#section-what-is-a-custom-schema) configuration to split your models across multiple schemas

# 2. Add more tests to your project

* Ensure that your `orders` model has at least one test on it (and it passes)

- [docs.getdbt.com](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing#section-schema-tests)

# 3. Set up your dbt project to run on CI
(Optional)

If you've been following a git flow (see earlier slide):
* Create a deployment environment (related [tutorial](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/deploy-your-project/))
* Set up continuous integration (related [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/deploy-your-project/))

Notes on the data (for teachers, hopefully the students discover some of these)
* singular table name
* no underscores in column names
* cased column names
* amount is in cents
* `created` vs. `created_date`

# Working session 2
We just got some payment data into our warehouse:

```sql
select * from raw.stripe.payment
```
.dense-text[
1. Build a `stg_payments` model to stage the payment data.
2. Build an `orders` model with the following fields:
    * `order_id`
    * `customer_id`
    * `amount` (hint: this has to come from payments)
3. Add a new field to the `customers` model:
    * `customers.lifetime_value`: the total amount a customer has spent at `jaffle_shop`

By the way, the Excel spreadsheet I've been using to raise venture capital says my all-time revenue is $1,672.

Discussion points (leading questions for the next session)

Where did our data come from? How do we know that?
* All of it was in the `raw` database
* Grouped into schemas based on the source

When building your models
* What did you name the files?
* How did you organize them in your models directory?

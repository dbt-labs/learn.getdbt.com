# Pull Requests

---

layout: false

# Why?

- This is how you ship/deliver/release your work.
- You _cannot_ merge code that is not approved.
- Your PR is your chance to make the argument that your code _should_ be merged.
It's not a chore, it's a powerful tool!

---

# We have a guide for that

Pull requests should:

- Tackle a single functional grouping of work.
- Include a description that explains the context of the changes to the code, as
well as what the code does. It's useful to include links to relevant cards/tickets,
other PRs, dbt docs, and screenshots of updated DAGs.
- Explain in detail any breaking changes after merging this code in production,
or what needs to be done to merge the code successfully.
- Show a "green" passing CI build, or explain any failing tests.

You can create _templates_ for pull request descriptions that will serve as
helpful guides to future contributors!

# WIP PRs

Pull requests can be used to collaborate on code, as they are a great way to
share the code you've written so far. In this scenario, use a **draft** pull request.

### Caveat

At present, dbt Cloud CI will run & test _all_ new commits to an open PR,
draft or otherwise.

---

# Any issues?

- Found a bug?
- Have an idea for an improvement?

Open an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)! You don't need to
have the code already written. If you get into a habit now of communicating
ideas and in-progress work to your colleagues, you'll thank yourself later.

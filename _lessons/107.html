# Why is documentation important?

_Low quality research manifests as an environment of knowledge cacophony,
where teams only read and trust research that they themselves created._
- Chetan Sharma and Jan Overgoor, [Scaling Knowledge at Airbnb](
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091)

### A lot of the reasons are self-explanatory...

---

# Analytics is the organization of an organization's information

* Analytics engineers are librarians
* Documentation is the card catalog
* The goal is to empower analyst-researchers
* _The libarian and the card catalog do not replace each otherâ€”they reinforce and enable each other!_

# Example: snowplow_sessions

{% raw %}
```yml
version: 2

models:
    - name: snowplow_sessions
      description: '{{ doc("snowplow_sessions") }}'

      columns:
          - name: session_id
            description: A visit / session identifier
            tests:
                - not_null
                - unique

          - name: user_custom_id
            description: Unique ID set by business, user_id

          - name: inferred_user_id

          - name: exit_page_url
            description: The last page URL

# Example: snowplow_sessions

```md
# Snowplow Sessions
{% docs snowplow_sessions %}

Sessions are discrete periods of activity by a user on a website. In Snowplow,
a session is typically defined as a series of activities followed by a 30-minute
window without any activity. If the same cookie visits the website after 30
minutes of inactivity, the javascript tracker will start a new session.

The Snowplow sessionization models _do not_ need to handle the determination of
when to start a new session; that is handled in the Snowplow javascript tracker
and saved in the `session_id` dimension of the event. The sessionization models
build a `snowplow_sessions` model that aggregates a large number data points
about the `session_id` that has been generated by the javascript tracker. Most
of this information is calculated on top of page views from `snowplow_page_views`.

Note that the `inferred_user_id` field should be used as the primary user
identifier in this model, as it has had "identity stitching" performed on it and
can therefore reliably trace a user's history through time and across browsers/devices.

Please view the [Snowplow Canonical Web Data Model](https://github.com/snowplow/web-data-model#32-sessions-table)
for more information on this model.

# Strong opinions

* Code is _surface area_. Testing and documentation are _coverage_.
* Untested, undocumented code _cannot be trusted_. In some sense, it is worse
than having no code at all.
* Data documentation that seeks to accurately describe data transformation _must_
be updated as part of the same workflow as the transformation logic it seeks to
describe. If they are separate, documentation will _always_ lag behind.

# Working session
* Add a docs block for one (or all!) of the following:
    * A model
    * A source
    * A column

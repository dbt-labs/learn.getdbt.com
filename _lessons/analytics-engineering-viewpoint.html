# Analytics code should be version controlled

---

## What is version control?

- Version control helps manage changes to your code:
    - You can see history, along with context
    - Your changes have a review process for approval + collaboration
    - Your team can work on projects at the same time
- Most teams use:
    - git for version control
    - GitHub to host their repo
    - Pull Requests for collaboration & approvals
- Some teams use complex [git flows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

---

## What does version control look like for analysts?
- `orders_final_this_one_is_final.xls`
- Bookmarking the right query in your web editor

???
- Instead of `final final v20`, or just bookmarking a change
- Your future self will thank you
---

## What does version control look like for analytics engineers?
- SQL is code, so…
- Exactly the same as software engineering:
    - git for version control
    - GitHub to host their repo
    - Pull Requests for collaboration & approvals
- We have a [git guide](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/master/git-guide.md) for those getting started

# Analytics code should have quality assurance

---

## What is QA?
* Adding tests to check that your code is reliable
* Tests give you peace of mind, and allow you to work faster
* Testing concepts in software engineering:
    * Unit tests
    * Integration tests

---
## What does QA look like in traditional analytics?

- Spreadsheets: add some check columns
- SQL: inspect a few rows, run a few queries (check for uniqueness etc)

---
## What does QA look like for analytics engineers?
- Run automated tests on source data and on transformed data to ensure that SQL works as intended
- Ensure source data is up to date
- Ensure that other systems won't break from any changes you makes

# Analytics should be modular
---

## What is modularity?
- Each tool solves a separate class of problems, and can be swapped in and out.
- Modularity on various scales in software engineering:
    - Using Stripe for payments
    - Using a python package for shared problems
    - Within a codebase, use separate modules (i.e. separate `.py` file)
    - Within a module, abstract repeated code into functions
- Easier to define what each module does
- Allows you to focus on what makes your business unique

???
Modularity exists on many levels in software engineering. From the macro of which tools you use to solve a problem, to the micro of how you write your code.

---

## What does modularity look like for analysts?

- Typically low modularity in the tech stack
- One system may cover many parts of your stack, e.g.:
    - Oracle as your data warehouse + ingestion tool
    - Looker as your BI + transformation tool
    - In-house tool for ETL
- Low modularity in queries: repeated snippets of SQL across many queries

???
Real life examples:
- Organizations that write the DML + DDL for every single transformation
- Really long queries that include business knowledge like "if cancelled_at is after shipped_at then refunded, else cancelled"

---

## What does modularity look like for analytics engineers?

- The modern data stack:

]
- Within a dbt project:
    - Using packages (more on this later)
    - Using separate models for different parts of transformation

???
From the pre-work: how we split up our code into separate "cleaning" and "transforming" models
Modularity happens at the macro and the micro: which tools we use all the way down to splitting code up into CTEs.

# Analytics should use environments

---

## What are environments?

Environments allow you to develop and test code without impacting the users of their software.

- **Production (prod):** the environment that end users interact with.  No one
can make changes in prod except for real human interaction/
- **Development (dev):** the environment engineers write code in
- **Staging / QA / CI / feature branches:** somewhere in between!

Releasing your code into production is called “deployment”.

---

## What do environments look like for analytics engineers?
- Run dev transformations in your own sandpit schema (`dev_jcohen`), run prod transformations in a trusted schema.
- Usually use prod data for these transformations

# Analytics workflows should be automated

---
## What do workflows look like in traditional analytics?
Manual processes:
1. Once a month: Run this query
2. Download the CSV
3. Paste the results into this Google Sheet
4. Copy and paste the charts into a board presentation

---
## What do workflows look like for analytics engineers?
Automated processes:
1. Data is ingested by Stitch/Fivetran
2. It is transformed and tested every 4 hours:
    * The latest version of the code is always used (continuous deployment)
    * Any errors are sent to a Slack channel
3. Your BI tool is connected to the production version of the data (environments)
3. Changes to the code are automatically tested before being merged (continuous integration)

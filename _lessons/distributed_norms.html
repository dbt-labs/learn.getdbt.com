???
During these two days, we want to introduce some norms so we can get the most out of today
* All In - If we are all fully present, this will be an impactful two days for everyone.  You might consider turning off notifications during lessons.
* Curiosity - Our sessions are driven by thoughtful, deep questions and everyone contributing their expertise.
* Community - While we are learning here, people are going to be at different places in their dbt skills.  Let's all support each other in getting better.  You might even make a long term connection in the data community!

# Scope of Learning

1. Software Engineering Principles
2. Hard analytics skills
3. Ecosystem Context

???
As we are working together, it might be helpful to think about your learning in these three buckets:
* dbt empowers analysts to use SE principles.  We will cover the principles so we know the theory behind their implementation.
* We will also learn concrete skills for building a dbt project of your own.
* Finally, our work operates in the modern data ecosystem.  We will all be stronger team members at our orgs if we understand this ecosystem.

# Two Methods of Learning

Content Presentations & Working Sessions


---

# Content Presentations

- **Video on**
- **Mic off**
- **Questions in the chat (moderated by another instructor)**

???
* As you may do in your own meetings, during content presentations, we will norm on videos on, mic off.
* Also, to preserve the flow of the content delivery, we would like to keep questions in that chat than pausing to ask them.
* Another teacher will moderate the chat and escalate questions if they make sense in the moment as opposed to at the end of a section.

# Checkpoint:

- How might learning about the modern data ecosystem make you a stronger team member?

--

- Recap: What's the purpose of the whiteboard again?

--

## Questions??

???
* The checkpoints will look like this with a couple of questions.
* Option A: Type your answer in the chat.
* Option B: Raise your hand to give a verbal response.

# Content Presentations

- Video on
- Mic off
- Questions in the chat (moderated by TA)
- Checkpoints
- Pausing for Questions
- **The Whiteboard**  

???
* We love to hear and honor a variety of questions.  
* Sometimes a question will be answered later in the course.
* Sometimes a question will require a longer conversation that may better be answered later in the course.
* In these cases, we will log these on a whiteboard.  Normally this is a physical whiteboard...

???
* But, we are working remotely :-)
* So we will keep track of these in a Google Doc like this one.
* Based on timing, we will revisit the whiteboard after lunch and at the end of each day.
* The link is in the SLACK channel if you want to add to this on your own.

---

# Working Sessions

- Video on
- Mic on
- Breakout Rooms
- Screensharing
- Share the floor - step up, step back

???
* The other method of learning will be working sessions!
* These will be chances to work in small groups with the support of a teacher.
* We will use Zoom's breakout rooms to manage these.

# Community Builder

In your breakout room...
- Introduce yourself again
- Find out who has a birthday closest to today (You are the screen sharer for this activity 😀)
- In the Google Doc - record your team name and everyone's favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors">Crayola Crayon Color.</a>
- When you see the prompt counting down the breakout rooms, let the timer run down before returning.

???
* (Send link to Google doc in the Slack Channel)
* We will do a quick icebreaker with breakout rooms to get to know each other a little better
* (Call on someone) could you read the slide for us

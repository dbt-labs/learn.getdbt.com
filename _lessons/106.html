# If any of the following is true...

* I'm switching my email marketing platform. (Or: I'm switching the tool that
extracts and loads _from_ my email marketing platform.) I want to know which 
final models depend on that source data.
--

* I'm switching from Redshift to Snowflake. All of my source data will be
in a different database/schema.
--

* Because no one is perfect, my data loading tools experience occasional 
hiccups or wrinkles that result in delayed or duplicated data
--

* My SQL transformations are working as expected, but my transformed data just 
doesn't look right. Help?!?!
--

* I want to stage & query data that lives in external file storage (!!)

---

# Sources may be right for you!

* Declare `database`, `schema`, and `table` names
* Test schema integrity (`unique`, `not_null`)
* Test loading freshness
* Declare `external` properties

# Familiar concepts

I define my sources in `stripe_source.yml`:
```yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: stripe
    tables:
      - name: payment
```

And then I create a staging model, `stg_stripe_payment.sql`:

{% raw %}
```sql
with source as (

    select * from {{source('stripe', 'payment')}}

),

renamed as (

...
```
{% endraw %}

# A common approach

* Define all `sources` in YML files contained within a subfolder, `models/sources`.
* Daily jobs runs commands in the following order:
```bash
dbt test -m sources             # ensure no duplicates or unexpected nulls
dbt run                         # only runs if test above succeeds
dbt test --exclude sources
dbt source snapshot-freshness
```

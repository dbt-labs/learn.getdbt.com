# dbt Materializations

---

# What is a materialization?

--

1. A special kind of **Jinja macro** that wraps your model SQL
    - Includes all the boilerplate DDL/DML: `create`, `alter`, `drop`, ...
--
2. An abstraction on top of the **database**
    - Does this model already exist in the database?
    - What if it exists as a table, but I want it to be a view?
    - What if Redshift uses `alter table` for views, but Snowflake uses
    `alter view`? (It's true!)

# Standard materializations

- Table
- View
- Ephemeral
- Incremental*
- Snapshot*

### You can write your own!

- Just like you can write your own macros, schema tests, etc.
- E.g. ["insert by period"](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#materializations)

- Materializations are some of the trickiest macros we write

# Imagine: some people

| id | name    | favorite_color | is_creative |
|----|---------|----------------|-------------|
| 1  | Alice   | green          | false       |
| 2  | Barbara | blue           | true        |

---

# Imagine: a model

`models/creative_people.sql`

```sql
select

    id as person_id,
    name,
    favorite_color

from raw_people
where is_creative = true
```

---

# Table

In the database: `analytics.creative_people`

| person_id | name    | favorite_color |
|----|---------|----------------|
| 2  | Barbara | blue           |

--

If we run:
```sql
select * from analytics.creative_people
```
We will see:

| person_id | name    | favorite_color |
|----|---------|----------------|
| 2  | Barbara | blue           |

---

# View

In the database: `analytics.creative_people`

```sql
select id as person_id, name, favorite_color
from raw_people
where is_creative = true
```

--

If we run:
```sql
select * from analytics.creative_people
```
We will see:

| person_id | name    | favorite_color |
|----|---------|----------------|
| 2  | Barbara | blue           |

---

# Ephemeral

- Does not exist in the database
- Reusable code snippet
- Interpolated as CTE in a model that `ref`s this model

--

If we run:
```sql
select * from analytics.creative_people
```
We will see:
```sql
Database Error
```

---

# What if...

| id | name    | favorite_color | is_creative |
|----|---------|----------------|-------------|
| 1  | Alice   | green          | false       |
| 2  | Barbara | blue           | true        |

--
| 3  | Casper  | red            | true        |

### What would you do?

* **Table:** Rebuild whole thing from scratch! Brute force always works.
* **View:** Recalculate every time I'm queried. Always up to date, often slow.
* **Ephemeral:** That's not really my problem, yanno? I just sorta go with the flow.

--
* **Incremental:** I've got an idea!

---

.left-column[
# The Big Idea

* Let's keep the old table, and we'll just _add_ the _new_ records
* Less wasteful and probably faster
* We just need to know:
    * What we mean by "new"
    * What we mean by "add"
* As long as we have good answers, we're in good shape

# Who is new?

And how do you know?

| id | name    | favorite_color | is_creative |
|----|---------|----------------|-------------|
| 1  | Alice   | green          | false       |
| 2  | Barbara | blue           | true        |
| .highlight[3]  | Casper  | red            | true        |

- The auto-increment ID from our source data system is greater than the previous
greatest auto-increment ID
- We can put unquestioning trust in our source data systems,
and have never been burned before

| id | name    | favorite_color | is_creative | created_date |
|----|---------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1  | Alice   | green          | false       | 2020-03-01   |
| 2  | Barbara | blue           | true        | 2020-03-02   |
| 3  | Casper  | red            | true        | .highlight[2020-03-03]   |

- A date when the record was initially created
- _Much_ more reliable than an auto-increment ID
- Records can only be created once and never updated later

... right?

# Knowledge check

You should be able to:
- Name the four materializatons
- Explain how dbt processes the tables, views, and ephemeral models differently

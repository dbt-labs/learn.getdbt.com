# Who is an analytics engineer?

# What is your day-to-day?

(And what do you call yourselves?)

## The traditional data team
- Data engineers:
    - Build data warehouse infrastructure
    - Extract & load data into your warehouse
    - Transform data to make it easier to work with
- Data analysts:
    - Build dashboards & reports
    - Insights work
- Stakeholders:
    - Politely wait for their analyst to give them numbers

## Modern data stack

???
- MPP warehouses replaced the need for engineers to maintain warehouse infrastructures
- Stitch and Fivetran got data into your warehouse, but the data was then in a source conformed format
- BI tools (Looker) allowed consumers to do their own deep dives into data
- Problem: people only had access to the raw data

Teaching notes:
- flip back to traditional data team and annotate to show how it doesn't make sense anymore (cross parts out, arrow other parts around, particularly stakeholders not wanting to wait for the analysts)

## Consequences of the modern data stack
Have you ever:
- Had two stakeholder have different values for a KPI, and not been sure what was right?
- Rewritten the same snippet of SQL, e.g:
```sql
select * from orders
where status not in ('cancelled', 'false')
    and deleted_at is null
    and user_id != 12
```
- Broken all your dashboards because of a bad join?
- Had data go stale (and only found out when someone else noticed?)

# Enter: dbt

???
* The solution? Transform your data in a shape that's ready for analytics
* Anyone who knows SQL can do this!
* This role is neither data engineering nor data analysis... it's analytics engineering

What do these software engineering best practices look like?

All that and more... after the break!

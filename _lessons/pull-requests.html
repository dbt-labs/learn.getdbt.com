# What's a PR?

- Final step in a git-based workflow
    - You've got a branch
    - I've got a branch
    - We both want to merge into `master`
- Checkpoint for quality control
    - Mechanism for review and approval by your colleagues
    - Automated testing (Continuous Integration)
- Also called **Merge Requests (MRs)**

---

# Why?

- This is how you ship, deliver, release your work
    - If it's never merged, did you really do it?
- You _cannot_ merge code that is not approved
- Your PR is your _opportunity_ to make the argument that your code _should_ be merged
    - It's not a chore, it's a powerful tool!

# We've got a [guide](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/corp/blob/master/git-guide.md) for that

Pull requests should:

- Tackle a single functional grouping of work.
- Include a description that explains the context of the changes to the code, as
well as what the code does. It's useful to include links to relevant cards/tickets,
other PRs, dbt docs, and screenshots of updated DAGs.
- Explain in detail any breaking changes after merging this code in production,
or what needs to be done to merge the code successfully.
- Show a "green" passing CI build, or explain any failing tests.

You can create _templates_ for pull request descriptions that will serve as
helpful guides to future contributors!*

# In progress?

- WIP PRs can be nice ways to share, collaborate, and comment on code,
even if it's not merge-ready
    - Some hosting platforms / organizations have **draft** pull requests enabled
    - Others adopt a naming convention: "WIP" or "DO NOT MERGE"
- **_Caveat:_** At present, dbt Cloud will trigger CI from _all_ new commits
pushed to an open PR (draft or otherwise)

???
The dbt Cloud trigger is something we're thinking about changing!

# No code yet?

If you...
- find a bug
- have an idea for an improvement
- want to share some long-term thinking

### _Open an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)!_

Things break and people have ideas all the time. If you get into a habit now of
communicating bugs, problems, and in-progress work to your colleagues early and
often, you'll thank yourself later.

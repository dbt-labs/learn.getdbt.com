During these two days, we want to introduce some norms so we can get the most out of today
* All In - If we are all fully present, this will be an impactful two days for everyone.  You might consider turning off notifications during lessons.
* Curiosity - Our sessions are driven by thoughtful, deep questions and everyone contributing their expertise.
* Community - While we are learning here, people are going to be at different places in their dbt skills.  Let's all support each other in getting better.  You might even make a long term connection in the data community!

# Quick Note about video

* If you have to step out for a personal reason, feel free to turn off your video and step out.

* When you return, please turn your video back on.  It is really helpful for building community and letting us know you are with us 😃

* Note: We might check in just to make sure you are doing alright if we see your video is off for a while.

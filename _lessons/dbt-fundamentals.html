# Setting the scene

???
Note to teacher:
- This presentation should be accompanied by re-doing the tutorial live.
- It comes after a number of lessons that are one-sided
- Ask the audience some questions / encourage participation. There will be some students who know all this already, so give them the opportunity to participate by helping answer questions.
- If people ask questions that are related to future lessons, jot them down on a shared place so you can cross them off throughout the rest of the course.

# Scenario

I'm an analyst working at "The Jaffle Shop". The Jaffle Shop uses our own app for order management:
.center[
<img src="/ui/img{{page.id}}/jaffle-shop-erd.png" style="width: 40%;">
]
I have a copy of this data replicated into my warehouse:
```sql
select * from raw.jaffle_shop.customers
```
--

## Why should I transform my data?
???
Hopefully answers like:
- clean up the data
- create news fields
- build trust/test it
- stop repeated work

---

# My project
* I'm going to transform my data to:
    * Clean up some dirtiness in my data (e.g. `user_id`)
    * Build some new fields on my customers model (`number_of_orders` etc.)
* And then connect my BI tool to the transformed data

# dbt Fundamentals


---

# The four ingredients for dbt

???
To use dbt, you need four things:

--

1. A data warehouse
???
* We're using Snowflake, your org might be using BigQuery / Redshift (or heaven forbid, spark)
* Flip to Snowflake console and show the data

--

    * that can run SQL
    * with data already loaded in to it

.center[
<img src="/ui/img{{page.id}}/data-warehouse.png" style="width: 50%;">
]

???
Questions to prompt:
- How does data get into the warehouse?

---
# The four ingredients for dbt

1. A data warehouse

2. A dbt project
--

    * created with the `init` command / `initialize` button
    * a directory with a `dbt_project.yml` file + other `.sql` and `.yml` files

.center[
<img src="/ui/img{{page.id}}/dbt-project.png" style="width: 50%;">
]

???
Create the project again/show off the models
Quick side step into models though...

---
# The four ingredients for dbt

1. A data warehouse

2. A dbt project
    * created with the `init` command / `initialize` button
    * a directory with a `dbt_project.yml` file + other `.sql` and `.yml` files
    * a project contains **models**
---
## What are models?

???
See if anyone wants to have a go at explaining a model
--

* Models are `select` statements that transform data.
* Stored in the `models` directory, and have a `.sql` extension


.center[
<img src="/ui/img{{page.id}}/model.png" style="width: 50%;">
]

---
# The four ingredients for dbt
1. A data warehouse

2. A dbt project

3. A connection to your warehouse
--

    * dbt CLI: a profile (that matches your the `profile:` in your `dbt_project.yml` file)
    * dbt Cloud: a connection
    * contains credentials to connect to your warehouse and a **target schema**

???
* Explain why this lives outside your project:
    * creds are sensitive and shouldn't be version controlled
    * target schemas should be different for each user, so shouldn't be hardcoded in a project
* Explain what a target schema is
* For CLI users — they might want more info on targets/profiles
---
# The four ingredients for dbt
1. A data warehouse

2. A dbt project

3. A connection to your warehouse

4. A command

--
    * an instruction, issued from the command line
    * e.g. `dbt run`


???
* Run `dbt run`!
* Explain what dbt is doing (wraps the select statement in DDL and runs it)
* Show where to see the logs


Good knowledge check questions:
* How did dbt connect to the warehouse? A: connection / profile
* How did dbt know what schema to use? A: the target schema
* What happens if you rerun dbt? A: no downtime (this looks different on each warehouse)

# The four ingredients for dbt
1. A data warehouse

2. A dbt project

3. A connection to your warehouse

4. A command

---
# What happens when you `dbt run`?
1. dbt connects to your **data warehouse** (via a **profile**/**connection**)
2. dbt parses your **dbt project**
3. dbt wraps your **models** in the appropriate DML (e.g. `create table as`)
4. dbt executes this SQL to build your models in your **target schema**

???
- Behind the scenes, tons more happening: checking if the schema exists etc.
--

* **How can I see what's happening?**
    * Check out the `target/` directory and the `logs/` file
* **How does dbt know the right SQL to use?** (`create table as` vs. `create view as`)
    * The way that dbt builds a model depends on the **materialization** you **configure** for a model.

---

# What is a materialization?

--
* `materializations` are build strategies
* i.e. the SQL that your `select` statement gets wrapped in
* Models can be materialized as `views` and `tables` (we'll learn more later!)
* You need to **configure** a model's materialization

---
#  What is a configuration?

--
* `configurations` are model settings
* They can be set in your `dbt_project.yml` file, _and_ in your model file.
* Configurations are applied _hierarchically_
* Example configurations:
    * `materialized='view'`
    * `tags=['nightly', 'hourly']`
    * `enabled=True`

???
* Show changing configurations, esp. examples that highlight hierarchical nature
---
# What happens when you `dbt run`?
1. dbt connects to your **data warehouse** (via a **profile**/**connection**)
2. dbt parses your **dbt project**
3. dbt wraps your **models** in the based on the the **materialization** you **configure** for a model (e.g. `create table as`)
4. dbt executes this SQL to build your models in your **target schema**

# Breathe!

???
Stop for questions at this point, make sure everyone is following.

---

# Let's do it again!
## This time for the Jaffle Shop

???
Instructions to teacher:
* Copy the query from the tutorial and run it

---

# Creating dependencies
* It's often a good idea to split up models
* Use the `ref` function to do build dependencies between models
* These dependencies form a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**
* dbt uses this DAG to understand the order to run models in

# DAGs

# Testing dbt models

???
* Add some tests to your models
* Demonstrate running one test at a time
---
# What are tests?
--

**Tests** are assertions you make about your **models**.

When your assertion is true, your tests pass.

Behind the scenes, tests are just `select` statements!

---
# What happens when you `dbt test`?
1. dbt connects to your **data warehouse** (via a **profile**/**connection**)
2. dbt parses your **dbt project**
3. dbt iterates through the schema files (`models/**.yml`) to construct `select` queries.
4. dbt executes the SQL for each test: if the number `0` is returned your test passes


---
# Other helpful commands
CLI:
* `dbt --help` (and `dbt run --help`)
* `dbt --version`
* `dbt debug`
* `dbt compile`

???
* Demo each command — for CLI users, it's worth realizing that these are pretty standard CLI commands!

---
# Knowledge check

You should be comfortable with these words:
.left-column[
* dbt project
* models
* target schema
* materializations
* DAGs
]
.right-column[
* configs
* refs
* configurations
* tests
]
---
# Knowledge check

You should be able to:
* Create new models (that depend on other models)
* Run your models (all of them / one model at a time)
* Check the SQL that's running
* Configure your models (from the `dbt_project.yml` file / within a model)
* Add tests to your models
* Run your tests (all of them / one model at a time)

🙋‍♀️ Please let us know if you want to go over any of these

???
Teacher notes:
* Use this as a checklist that you've covered everything off
* Emphasize that we're going to launch off from here — use the lunch time to make sure that everyone is following so far.
* For those who do understand, there's a working session

# Working session
We just got some payment data into our warehouse:

```sql
select * from raw.stripe.payment
>>>
| ID | orderID | paymentMethod | AMOUNT | CREATED    |
|----|---------|---------------|--------|------------|
| 1  | 1       | credit_card   | 1000   | 2018-01-01 |
| 2  | 2       | credit_card   | 2000   | 2018-01-02 |
| 3  | 3       | coupon        | 100    | 2018-01-04 |
| 4  | 4       | coupon        | 2500   | 2018-01-05 |
| 5  | 5       | bank_transfer | 1700   | 2018-01-05 |

```
???
Notes on the data (for teachers, hopefully the students discover some of these)
* singular table name
* no underscores in column names
* cased column names
* amount is in cents
* `created` vs. `created_date`

# Working session
We just got some payment data into our warehouse:

```sql
select * from raw.stripe.payment
```

1. Build an `orders` model with the following fields:
    * `order_id`
    * `customer_id`
    * `amount` (hint: this has to come from payments)
2. Add a new field to the `customers` model:
    * `customers.lifetime_value`: the total amount a customer has spent at `jaffle_shop`

{% include options/next_presentation.html %}

???
Discussion points (leading questions for the next session)

Where did our data come from? How do we know that?
* All of it was in the `raw` database
* Grouped into schemas based on the source

When building your models:
* What did you name the files?
* How did you organize them in your models directory?
* Did you test these models? Did you document them?

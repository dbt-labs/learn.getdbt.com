## Client:
Events Manager

## Context
"I've been selling tickets to events lately. I want a report showing how many tickets I've sold and refunded for each event."

## Available data:
```sql
select * from raw.ticket_tailor.orders;
select * from raw.learn_stripe.charges;
select * from raw.learn_stripe.refunds;
```

---

# Discussion
* Which parts should go in dbt? Which in our BI tool?
* How would you break up this project?

# My typical process
.denser-text[
1. **What am I trying to build?**
    - Draw a dashboard or the table of data
    - Identify the grain
2. **What data sources do I have? How do they join together?**
    - Add sources to our dbt project
    - Add assumptions about sources as tests
3. **Create V0**
    - Write a query that works & validate the results
    - Jot down to-dos as I go
4. **Refactor**
    - Make my code align with best practices
5. **Create a PR**
    - Send it to someone to review!

# Review

**Traditional Data Teams**
**Traditional Data Teams** are composed of Data Engineers and Data Analysts.
* Data Engineers are responsible for maintaining data infrastructure and the ETL process for creating tables and views.
* Data Analysts focus on querying tables and views to drive business intelligence for stakeholders.

**ETL and ELT**
* ETL (extract transform load) is the process of creating new database objects by extracting data from the database, transforming it on a local or third party machine, and loading the transformed data into the database.
* ELT (extract load transform) is a more recent process of creating new database objects that involves first extracting/loading raw data into a data warehouse and then transforming said data directly in the warehouse.
* The new ELT process is made possible by the introduction of new cloud base data warehouse technologies.

**Analytics Engineering**
* Analytics engineers focus on the transformation of raw data into transformed data that is ready for analysis.  This new role to a data team changes the nature of data engineers and data analysts.
* Data Engineers can now focus on larger data architecture and the EL in ELT.
* Data Analysts can focus on insight and dashboard work using the transformed data.
* Note: At a small company, a data team of one may own all three of these roles and responsibilities.  As your team grows, you the lines between these roles will remain blurry.

**dbt**
* data build tool (dbt) empowers data teams to leverage software engineering principles to the T in ELT.
* The focus of this course will be on building your skill and mindset around dbt to give you more leverage in your work.

## Practice 
Using the resources in this module, complete the following in your dbt project:

#### Try it Yourself
Follow the video called Packages with Macros to:
- Add the `dbt_utils` package to your project.
- Use the `date_spine` macros to build a data spine model in your project called `all_dates`.  This model should list every day in the year 2020.
- Use a config block to materialize `all_dates` as a table. (The default materilizatino will be a view)

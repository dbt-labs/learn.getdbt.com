  This is the footer code you define in Advanced Settings -> Site Footer Code
  It is expected that this code is ALREADY wrapped in a <script> tag

  This code runs in the footer of every page on your site,
  regardless of whether it is a part of the theme or not.

  Note that this is the LAST custom Javascript that runs in the page.

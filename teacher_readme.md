# Teacher Readme
_Here is a quick reference guide for different teacher moves that are included in the lesson decks.  Videos of presentations can be found at the bottom as well._

## View Speaker Notes
The slides are made with [Remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark). When you have a slide deck open, you can press `C` on your keyboard to clone the slides, which means that another window will open that looks exactly the same.  Focus on the new window and press `P` to go into presenter mode, which will show the speaker notes and give you a handy timer (the timer starts when you first click forward on a slide). Now you can view the slides and speaker notes together. When you advance the slides in presenter mode, it will also advance the slides in the original window.

## Focus Slides
### Purpose
- Provide focus to the teacher so they know what to make *pop* during the lesson.
- Provide focus for the learners so they know where we are headed with this lesson.
- Provide the planner with focus for what the specific lesson is intended to accomplish.  This helps create alignment between the slides and the broader goal of the lesson.

### Execution
- In most cases, these have been placed *after* some sort of *hook* to get the group interested in the lesson.
- This is an opportunity for learners to read the slides for the rest of the group.
- This is also an opportunity as the teacher to build some excitement around these learning objectives.
- Bottom Line - Read the room: What will give the group more energy in this moment?  Reading the slides yourself with engagement -OR- calling on a learner to change up who is speaking.

## Checkpoint Slides

### Purpose
- There is a lot of content to cover during these two days of dbt Learn.
- Checkpoints create an opportunity to see if our learners can name some key takeaways from the lesson.
- This also is a method for breaking up longer presentations.
- These create a specific point during the lessons for the entire group to engage in conversation around important concepts/practices

### Execution
- It is important that presenters provide clarity around *how* to answer these questions.
- It is powerful if presenters can norm on this for all checkpoints
- Here are some options:
  - **Hand Raise:** "Using the 'Hand Raise' feature, raise your hand to answer these questions.  We will then call on three people to build off each other in response."
  - **Type Answers:** "Type your answers into the chat to everyone.  *Read question #1*  Call on people to explain answers.  *Read question #2* ...."
  - **Cold Call:** "We will be using cold call for these questions.  This is not meant to be a 'gotcha' but instead a chance to get everyone involved.  Be ready to answer ðŸ˜€.

## Zoom Out Slides

### Purpose
- Each lesson gets into the specifics of its topic.
- Lessons can seem to be somewhat disconnected.
- The Zoom Out slides provide an opportunity to step back and make *brush strokes* between lessons and make connections.

### Execution
- Note: Each Zoom Out slide has a transition.  The original slide will show the lessons up to and including the current lesson for the day.  After the transition, the rest of the lessons for the day will be shown with the next slide highlighted.
- h/t Jeremy for writing the `Liquid` to automate this.
- Before transition: "Wow!  We have covered a ton today.  Just this afternoon, we learned how to configure tests to make sure our code is reliable, set up sources to version control references to raw tables, and we just learned how to document our analytics work for various stakeholders."
- After transition: "To close out the day, we are going to jump into a group assignment and get hands. on. keyboards.  But first, we are going to take a break - it is 3:30...we will come back at 3:40 - see you in a bit.

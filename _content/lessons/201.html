polish your dbt project:
- update your readme! useful info:
    - how to get creds to use this
    - links on how to get set up
    - mentions of coding conventions (does this go here? I think so!)
- require-dbt-version
- github templates:
        - especially with a checklist!
- remove comments from your dbt_project.yml file (ðŸ™ƒ)
- if using the CLI: include a sample profile for others
- overview.md?
- no direct table dependencies
- apply configurations at the group level

polish your workflow:
- optimize your code editor:
        - highlighting
        - snippets
        - compiled SQL
- use coding conventions

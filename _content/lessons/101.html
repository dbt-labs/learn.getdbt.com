.left-column[
  ### Data Analyst

  - Build custom data ingestion integrations
  - Manage overall pipeline orchestration
  - Develop and deploy machine learning endpoints
  - Build and maintain the data platform
  - Data warehouse performance optimization

]
.right-column[
  ### Data Engineer

  - Deep insights work (ex: Why did churn spike last month? What are the best acquisition channels?)
  - Work with business users to understand data requirements
  - Build critical dashboards
  - Forecasting

## Enter: Analytics Engineer

- Provide clean data sets to end users
    - Models data in a way that empowers end users to answer their own questions.
- Spends their time transforming, testing, deploying, and documenting data.
- Applies software engineering best practices like version control and continuous integration (CI) to the analytics code base

# When and why? A brief history

---

## The traditional data stack (circa 2012)

- First data hire was probably a data engineer
    - Built infrastructure: extract data from the Postgres database and SaaS tools that ran your business, transform that data, and then load it into your data warehouse
- Then hire a data analyst to build dashboards and reports on top of this data.
    - Maintain messy SQL files with names like monthly_revenue_final.sql
    - Or bookmark their queries in a SQL web editor
    - Maybe supplement analyses with Excel work
- Execs receive monthly reports of company’s metrics

---

## Changes since then

- Cloud-based data warehouses made data storage and processing affordable and fast
    - Redshift, Snowflake, BQ
- Data pipeline services (ex: Stitch, Fivetran) turned data extraction into work that took only a few clicks
- Business intelligence (BI) tools (ex: Looker, Mode, Chartio) increased ability for stakeholders to be self-service.

---

## Changes and consequences

- Business users self-serviced and data-driven
- Anyone could write a SQL statement to get a metric
    - but doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true!

- The solution: transform the raw data into a shape that’s ready for analytics. At the time, there were only two widely-used options:
- Looker’s Persistent Derived Tables
    - Get a data engineer involved

---

## dbt and the modern data team

- First data hire = someone who ends up owning the entire data stack
    - Sets up ETL tool, chooses data warehouse to funnel into, cleans and adds key business logic to the date, and which BI tool to report the data in
- Not data engineering, nor analysis…
- Hence the position, “Analytics Engineer” began

---

## “Analytics Engineer”

Provide clean, transformed data ready for analysis
 Apply software engineering practices to analytics code (ex: version control, testing, continuous integration)
Maintain data documentation & definitions
Train business users on how to use a data platform data visualization tools

...but the lines are a bit blurry

(And what do you call yourselves?)

## The traditional data stack (circa 2012)

- First data hire was probably a data engineer
    - Built infrastructure: extract data from the Postgres database and SaaS tools that ran your business, transform that data, and then load it into your data warehouse
- Then hire a data analyst to build dashboards and reports on top of this data.
    - Maintain messy SQL files with names like monthly_revenue_final.sql
    - Or bookmark their queries in a SQL web editor
    - Maybe supplement analyses with Excel work
- Execs receive monthly reports of company’s metrics


---
## Changes since then

- Cloud-based data warehouses made data storage and processing affordable and fast
    - Redshift, Snowflake, BQ
- Data pipeline services (ex: Stitch, Fivetran) turned data extraction into work that took only a few clicks
- Business intelligence (BI) tools (ex: Looker, Mode, Chartio) increased ability for stakeholders to be self-service.


---

## Changes and consequences
**Make this more verbose**
- Have you ever...

- Business users became more self-service
- This often resulted in mismatched numbers due to gaps in business knowledge:
    - Example: how many orders did we have last month?
        - Was it cancelled?
        - Was it returned?
        - Is deleted_at null?
        - Was the `user_id = 12`?
- The solution: transform the raw data into a shape that’s ready for analytics.
- **dbt puts this transformation firmly within the reach of anyone who knows SQL**
